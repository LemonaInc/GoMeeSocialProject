# Swift Final Project

GoMee is a free-subscription, location based-augmented reality application. With GoMee you will discover and join new friends at your favorite events.

Meet and make new friends while getting involved in the most fun and entertaining events around the city.

In our final project, we wanted to create an application that can be extended in the future. Our first version of our app includes a custom collection view controller and a cell that allow the user to select the event or activity they want to do. Right now we are just using fake data to fill in the collection view but in the future, this will include real events, hikes, activities and concerts around you. Our app also loads images using the asynchronous method from a php file which is on our server. The images that are in the php file are in an array and are parsed into the application. Sometimes this is slow and the image size could be a result of that.

# Frameworks and Library's used in GoMee

In our project, we used the Facebook Account Kit framework and also included a Material Kit library. Please note all rights for the frameworks that were included in our project should be given to the respective developers and were not created by Jaxon, Wuttipat or anyone on the GoMee team.
