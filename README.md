# Swift Final Project
In our final prokect we wanted to create an application that can be extended in the future. Our first verson of our app includes a custom collection view controller and cell that allow the user to select the event or activity they want to do. Right now we are just using fake data to fill in the collection view but in the future this will include real events, hikes, activitys and concerts around you. Our app also loads images using the asynchronous method from a php file hosted at: http://www.jsdev.info/images_php which is on our server. The images that are in the php file are in an array and are parsed into the application. Sometimes this is slow and the image size could be a result of that. 

Thank you for your time and hopefully you enjoy our final project.
Created by Jaxon and Wuttipat.
